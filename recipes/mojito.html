    <h2>Mojito</h2>
    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, 
      but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. 
      Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you 
      might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find 
      yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>
